# MasterChefJuniorVeggiePizza
Bring out base of pizza and tomato sauce and spread tomato sauce over the pizza base. 
Next, choose some veggies that you want. 
For example tomatoes, green peppers, olives, etc. 
Grate them and then spread them across your pizza however you want. 
Next grate the cheese and spread it over the pizza however you would like. 
After that has all been done, preheat the oven, and then put the pizza in the oven and let it cook for a while at the right temperature.
After some time around 15-20 minutes, your pizza would be ready, take it out and eat and enjoy.
